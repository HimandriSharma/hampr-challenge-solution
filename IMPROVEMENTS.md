# Hampr Frontend Challenge

### Improvements that can be done in the application : 

1. Styling is not very accurate as per the designs by working on more customizations it can be made exactly same.
2. At few plaes TypeScript inferred any types which can further be worked upon and improved.
3. As I had static data in the APP I used hooks but for complex state management Redux can be incorporated.
4. If required more components can be distributed on the charater page into files to increase readability.
5. We can add error fallback pages for random link visit by user.
